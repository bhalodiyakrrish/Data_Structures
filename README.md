### List
Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items. They can hold items of different data types.
### Tuple
Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items. Once created, you can't change their values.
### Set
Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are useful for storing distinct elements and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
### Dictionary
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are useful for storing data that can be accessed by unique keys.
### Stack
Stacks follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. You can use a list to implement a stack in Python.
### Queue
Queues follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. You can use a list or collections.deque to implement a queue in Python.
### Linked List
Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are linked using pointers.
### Tree
Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes.
### Graph
Graphs are data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.

This repository contains examples of various types of data structures in Python, including list, sets, and dictionary. It is designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of data structures constructs in Python.
